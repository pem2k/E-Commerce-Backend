## Installation

This project can be installed by cloning the repo. Once the files are open in a terminal of your choice, install the required dependencies in package.json using the command "npm install"

## Usage

Once the required dependencies have been installed, the program can be used by running the schema.sql file in the db folder in a sql instance. Create a file in the root directory called ".env", include the db_name, db_username, and db_password, in key value pairs alongside their coorsponding values.  Once complete, run the commands "npm run seed" and "npm start". From there, the server will be up and ready for testing.
